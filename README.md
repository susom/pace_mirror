# Pediatric Acute Care Data Mirror


#### This module was developed to mirror participant data from Rhapsode to REDCap

## Configuration
#### The project makes use of the following system settings:
 - `rhapsode-url` API endpoint corresponding to survey data in REDCap
 - `rhapsode-username` Rhapsode credentialed username
 - `rhapsode-password` Rhapsode credentialed password

Note: Current credentials only have access to surveys in Rhapsode created by **self** & user **meaneypa**

Cron is configured to run once a day and copy over data for individuals under the following conditions:
1. User in rhapsode payload matches consented user (surname + given name) exactly
2. If user has no weekly progress -- rhapsode data will be copied into baseline week 0 event on consent date
3. If user has weekly progress, rhapsode data will be copied into corresponding event every seven days starting from consent date
